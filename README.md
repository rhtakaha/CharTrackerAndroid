# CharTrackerAndroid
This is an Android Native mobile app designed to make it easy to keep track of all the different characters in all the different stories you are trying to keep up on. It is easy to forget about a particular detail about a character (or perhaps an entire character) when engaging with a complex story. 
This could be due to a forced break (such as waiting for the next season/movie/book to release), not having the time to engage with the story, or just getting busy and forgetting. This can make re-engaging with a story feel very daunting.
CharTracker aims to help by providing an organized and straightforward way to quickly note down some key features of each character so that you are ready to jump back in at any time.

## Background
This is a complete Native Android rebuild of an app idea I worked on for a few months with React Native. Going into that React Native I had no mobile experience and chose React Native due to it being multiplatform. 
As I continued working on it I kept running into issues where features/libraries needed access to native features. 
I took a break from the project and upon coming back I realized that it would probably just be better to write an Android app since that is the hardware I have available and then I can have full access to native systems.
I spent some time on the Udacity "Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers" and "Developing Android Apps with Kotlin" courses to have a better context.
